\begin{itemize}
	\item Define a new DynamoDB table in the \emph{serverless.yml};
	\item Create an operationQueue and an executionQueue with SQS;
	\item Define all the Lambda functions you need in the \emph{serverless.yml};
	\item Define the trigger events in the \emph{serverless.yml};
	\item Create a handler file named \emph{"aggregate\_handler.js"} in the project's root which contains the Lambda's handlers that refer the same aggregate type;
	\item Add the new handlers file in the module.exports of the main handler;
	\item Deploy the serverless application.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{New write functions}
To add a new write function you have to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define the function's name and te corresponding handler's name in the \emph{serverless.yml};
	\item Define trigger events in the \emph{serverless.yml};
	\item Create an \emph{operationAggregateQueue} and an \emph{executeOperationAggregateQueue}; 
	\item In the \emph{"aggregate\_handler.js"} you must write:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a \emph{pushOperationAggregateToSQS} function to push the event in the corresponding queue;
		\item a \emph{commandOperationAggregate} function to check if the event is valid and store it into the \emph{eventStore};
		\item an \emph{operationAggregate} function to execute the event and update the view.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Deploy the serverless application.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{New read functions}
To add a new read function you have to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define the function's name and te corresponding handler's name in the \emph{serverless.yml};
